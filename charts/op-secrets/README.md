# 1Password Secrets

This chart deploys a OnePasswordItem object for a specific 1Password vault and item, and a job that will wait for the related k8s secret to be generated by the 1Password operator.

## Usage

This chart is primarily used as a dependency of the permissionless-nodes chart, to have op-secrets pushed in the cluster prior to deploying the pless node itself.
